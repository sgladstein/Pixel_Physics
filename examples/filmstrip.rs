//! Renders a scene to a **contact sheet**: several frames of one run laid out
//! in a grid, through the same `Renderer` the sandbox itself draws with, with
//! no window and no GPU.
//!
//! This exists because a numeric metric only ever sees the one quantity it was
//! written to see, and choosing that quantity correctly turns out to be the
//! hard part. Repeatedly, a metric written before anyone had looked at the
//! artifact measured the wrong thing and reported "nothing here" on a scene
//! that visibly had something: surface height hid a 9x chunk-seam effect that
//! column volume showed plainly, and occupancy hid torn seam rows that were a
//! fill deficit rather than a hole. Worse, a metric cannot see what it was not
//! asked about, so a fix that cleared one artifact while introducing a larger
//! one passed its own test and had to be reverted from live play
//! (`e816477`). An image has the opposite property: it shows everything at
//! once, including whatever nobody thought to measure.
//!
//! `examples/ascii.rs` already makes this argument ("movement rules are far
//! easier to judge by eye than by assertion") and answers it in the terminal.
//! This answers it in actual pixels, which is what the bug reports are about.
//!
//! # Why a grid rather than a GIF
//!
//! `main.rs`'s capture hook already writes a `sequence.gif`, and it is the
//! right thing for a human watching it. But several of these bugs are only
//! legible *in motion* — a fringe that regenerates every frame reads very
//! differently from one that sits still — and an animation cannot be taken in
//! at a glance or quoted in a report. Laying time out along space solves both:
//! one image, one look, motion visible as difference between neighbouring
//! tiles.
//!
//! # Why crop and zoom are not optional extras
//!
//! At 1:1 a one-pixel-tall dark line across a 512-wide world is genuinely
//! easy to miss — that is exactly how the horizontal chunk-seam tearing went
//! unnoticed until it was pointed out. `crop` and `zoom` are the difference
//! between "I looked at it" and "I saw it".
//!
