//! M17: structural integrity — destructible building with no solver.
//!
//! Each `Solid` cell stores in `Cell::aux` its distance, in cells, to the
//! nearest anchor — bedrock, or the world edge (the same `Cell::OUT_OF_BOUNDS`
//! sentinel already used everywhere else a rule needs to treat the world's
//! edge as a wall). A cell whose distance exceeds its material's
//! `max_unsupported_span` is unsupported and breaks free, converting into
//! `breaks_into` — loose material the ordinary CA sweep then makes fall.
//! No polygons, no connected-component labelling, no physics solver; M8
//! upgrades the "falls as loose material" part into coherent tumbling
//! bodies later without this milestone needing to change.
//!
//! # Why this is a label-correcting relaxation, not a one-shot BFS
//!
//! Distance is a shortest-path property: `d = 0` at an anchor, otherwise
//! `d = 1 + min(neighbouring Solid cells' d)`. Recomputing it for one cell
//! is cheap; the question is when to bother. This module never scans the
//! whole world — `structural_tick` recomputes exactly one cell's distance
//! from its neighbours' *already-stored* values, and only propagates
//! (reschedules its `Solid` neighbours too) when the recomputed value
//! actually *changed*. A cell whose distance is stable simply stops being
//! rescheduled, exactly like a moss tip with nowhere left to grow —
//! propagation is a wavefront that spreads outward from a disturbance and
//! dies out on its own once nothing more is changing, which is what keeps
//! this "bounded by the size of the affected structure" the way the plan
//! asks for, not a cost proportional to world size.
//!
//! # Why checks are scheduled reactively, never at world-gen time
//!
//! If every `Solid` cell were checked from frame one, the sandbox's own
//! starting terrain would immediately fail: the floor is 8 cells thick
//! (deeper than stone's span of 3) and the decorative ledges float with no
//! path to an anchor at all. Under a literal reading of the mechanic both
//! would start crumbling the instant this milestone shipped — not a
//! demonstration of anything, just a surprise regression in what M1-M15
//! already established looked right. `structural_tick` is only ever
//! scheduled by something that actually disturbs a structure — painting
//! new `Solid` material, erasing it, an explosion clearing a radius (see
//! `World::paint_capsule` and `explosion::trigger`) — never by world
//! generation. Pre-placed terrain's `aux` simply stays at its default (0)
//! forever unless something reaches over and disturbs it, which is
//! indistinguishable from "anchored" for any cell nothing ever asks about.
//! Once a player builds and then breaks something, the mechanic is exactly
//! as real as the plan describes.
