//! M8: rigid bodies — deliberately started narrow.
//!
//! The plan's own words for this milestone: "the largest single
//! milestone — treat as its own project" and "the risk concentration;
//! deferred as far as it sensibly can be." Its full pipeline is
//! connected-component labeling → marching squares contour → Douglas-Peucker
//! simplification → `earcutr` triangulation → a `rapier2d` collider →
//! erase-step-re-rasterize every frame. That is real, separate engineering
//! at every stage, not one afternoon's work, and the plan's own execution-
//! order reasoning explicitly warns against rushing it: "the most exciting
//! item and the one most likely to consume months without a playable
//! result."
//!
//! This module covers the pipeline's first two stages: connected-component
//! labeling over the CA grid, and boundary/contour extraction from a
//! labeled component. Douglas-Peucker simplification, `earcutr`
//! triangulation, and the `rapier2d` collider/step/re-rasterize loop are
//! not yet built. Nothing here pulls in `rapier2d` or commits to any of
//! that later pipeline's design decisions — those are better made
//! deliberately than rushed at the tail of an unattended session. See
//! `PLAN.md`'s M8 section and progress log for what's built versus what
//! remains.
//!
//! # Why `trace_contours` isn't the classic marching-squares algorithm
//!
//! Classic marching squares walks a *continuous* scalar field sampled at
//! grid corners, and needs its 16-case lookup table (plus a tie-break rule
//! for the two ambiguous "saddle" cases) specifically because interpolated
//! corner values can disagree about which way a contour bends between them.
//! This engine's input is already a *binary* per-cell occupancy grid — a
//! cell is either in the component or it isn't, nothing to interpolate —
//! so the exact same problem (turn a filled region into its boundary
//! polygon) has a simpler, unambiguous solution: every unit square cell
//! contributes a directed boundary edge on each side that faces a
//! non-filled neighbour, oriented so the filled interior is always on the
//! edge's right (a clockwise walk around outer boundaries, since this
//! engine's `y` grows downward like screen space); interior edges between
//! two filled cells never appear at all, because *neither* side of that
//! edge sees a non-filled neighbour. Stitching those directed edges
//! head-to-tail by shared endpoints reconstructs every closed loop — outer
//! boundaries and hole boundaries alike, with hole boundaries falling out
//! already wound the opposite way, no special-casing needed. This is
//! marching squares' actual job for exactly the input this pipeline stage
//! ever has to handle, without carrying machinery (interpolation, the
//! saddle tie-break) built for a continuous-field case that can't occur
//! here.
//!
//! **Known limitation, not handled**: a component that touches itself at
//! exactly one shared *corner* (two cells diagonally adjacent, connected to
//! each other only through a longer 4-connected path elsewhere — a
//! "pinch point") produces a corner point with two outgoing boundary edges,
//! and the last one processed silently wins. `label_component`'s strict
//! 4-connectivity makes this rare in practice (most bodies a player would
//! actually cut free are simply-connected blobs), but the geometry is
//! genuinely wrong wherever it happens — the dropped edge reroutes that
//! lobe's walk into the *other*, already-closed lobe's cycle rather than
//! back to its own start, so the traced ring is not a valid simple polygon
//! there. An independent review found and this module now guards against a
//! worse failure mode than "wrong geometry": without the `visited`-membership
//! check in `trace_contours`' inner walk, that reroute cycles the sibling
//! lobe forever, since it never revisits the dropped lobe's own `start`
//! point — an unbounded hang, not a bounded wrong answer. The guard turns
//! that hang into a bounded, wrong, terminating ring (on par with the
//! classic algorithm's own saddle-case ambiguity, which is the severity
//! this was always meant to have); it does not make the ring correct.
//! Resolving that needs the same kind of tie-break rule marching squares
//! uses for saddles — not implemented here.
