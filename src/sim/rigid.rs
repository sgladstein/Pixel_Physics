//! M8: rigid bodies — deliberately started narrow.
//!
//! The plan's own words for this milestone: "the largest single
//! milestone — treat as its own project" and "the risk concentration;
//! deferred as far as it sensibly can be." Its full pipeline is
//! connected-component labeling → marching squares contour → Douglas-Peucker
//! simplification → `earcutr` triangulation → a `rapier2d` collider →
//! erase-step-re-rasterize every frame. That is real, separate engineering
//! at every stage, not one afternoon's work, and the plan's own execution-
//! order reasoning explicitly warns against rushing it: "the most exciting
//! item and the one most likely to consume months without a playable
//! result."
//!
//! This module is the first stage only: connected-component labeling over
//! the CA grid, the input the rest of the pipeline (marching squares, not
//! yet built) would contour. Nothing here pulls in `rapier2d` or commits to
//! any of that later pipeline's design decisions — those are better made
//! deliberately than rushed at the tail of an unattended session. See
//! `PLAN.md`'s M8 section and progress log for what's built versus what
//! remains.
