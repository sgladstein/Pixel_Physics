//! M18 Phase 1: cell-based creatures — a worm that burrows through loose
//! material.
//!
//! Dispatched from `scheduler::step` once per due active site, the same
//! shape M16's `plant.rs` and M17's `structural.rs` use — everything here
//! writes through the ordinary `World::get`/`set`, since this runs as its
//! own frame phase separate from the CA sweep. Fire (catching light,
//! burning to a corpse) is deliberately *not* implemented here at all: M14's
//! `fire.rs` already applies to every material kind uniformly, purely from
//! `.ron` data (flammability, ignition temperature, `burns_into`), so giving
//! `worm.ron` real thermal numbers gets a burning, dying worm for free.
//! This module only owns the part fire.rs can't: *choosing to move*.
//!
//! Grounded in `research/m18-creature-biology.md`, not invented from
//! plausible-looking rules — see that file for full citations. The three
//! mechanisms translated directly:
//!
//! 1. **Burrowing cost from substrate physics, not a material whitelist**
//!    (Kurth et al. 2018; golden mole energetics) — see `move_cost`.
//! 2. ***C. elegans*-style thermotaxis** for fire avoidance — compare the
//!    local M13 ambient-temperature field against a threshold, flee
//!    down-gradient once it's crossed. See `sense_fire`.
//! 3. **An energy budget driving movement**, replacing random wandering —
//!    depletes on every move (more on burrowing than open ground), is
//!    partially replenished by "eating" the powder it burrows through, and
//!    starvation is what actually kills a permanently-trapped worm rather
//!    than a separate dormancy counter (contrast `plant.rs`'s
//!    `MOSS_STALE_LIMIT`, which exists because moss has no energy stat to
//!    let staleness resolve itself).
//!
//! Known simplification, not yet built: the Marginal Value Theorem's
//! patch-leaving rule (leave once local intake drops below the
//! environment's running average) needs a maintained average-intake
//! estimate this first cut doesn't keep. What's here instead — prefer
//! burrowing into powder over drifting through open space, whenever both
//! are available — captures "the worm has a reason to move" without the
//! full bookkeeping; a closer match is future work. Multiple creature kinds
//! interacting (Wa-Tor-style predator/prey) and the slime/fungus shared
//! resource-gradient primitive are also out of scope for this first cut —
//! see the research file's section 4 and 5.
