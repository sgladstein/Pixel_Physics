# The evolution lab — coordinator note

*`cargo run --release --bin lab` is the second game: a sealed box of soil under
grow lights where the shipped plants and ants live. Design of record:
[`../evolution-lab-design-guide-2026-08-30.md`](../evolution-lab-design-guide-2026-08-30.md),
with [`../evolution-lab-feasibility-2026-08-30.md`](../evolution-lab-feasibility-2026-08-30.md)
under it.*

**Read this before picking the lab up.** Twenty rounds have been run here since
2026-08-30. One to nineteen are history and moved on 2026-09-08 to
[`../evolution-lab-rounds-archive.md`](../evolution-lab-rounds-archive.md) —
verbatim, with a priced contents table and a per-round map of which round belongs
to which of the three concurrent lines. What stays here is what still binds.

## What binds on anything you do here

**The owner's standing direction, which reframes the whole programme** (round
three, and it has not been superseded):

> *"Your goals are not tweaking and optimizing evolution now. **Give me the
> tools, data, access to the parameters that need to be tweaked and I do that
> testing myself in the game. That is the game.** If I have access to food,
> water, can cull, can create plants, and creatures, I can figure it out."*

**So: stop balancing, start exposing.** A default that looks wrong is something
to **register and report**, never to tune.

**Ship new behaviours as default** (round twenty). Reach is not behaviour:
nothing born swinging or listening is `CLAUDE.md`'s second law failing quietly.

**Read the bed at a session, not at a minute.** The owner's own framing — a
session is a few hundred thousand frames and a million is several sessions. At
that length **every shipped bed starves its ant colony**, on every seed, with
births plentiful: [`../open-bugs-handoff.md` §Z6](../open-bugs-handoff.md)
carries the table and the bar a fix has to clear. **§Z6 is upstream of the
castes question, the kin drift and Gate 2 alike** — a channel cannot be *found*
by a line that does not outlive a session; **round twenty-one answers its open
question.** Every creature result in archived
rounds twelve to eighteen was taken at a few minutes of play at most and is
true at that length only — **the owner's machine is the ruler, not this
container's**: a full box runs at 1–4x there and one plant at 40x, so 24,000
frames of the full box is two to seven minutes and 300,000 is a long session
(the container's 6x is where "one minute" came from, and it is wrong for the
owner). A session census costs six to eight minutes a bed on one core, so it
is the cheap default from here on, not the expensive exception.

**Deliberately not being built yet:** the score and the economy, the guide's
Gate 5. **Gate 2 — does selection have teeth in *this* bed — passes for
creatures**, and this paragraph carried the opposite claim for weeks:
`creature_arena arm=lethal`, a zeroed brain against the shipped one, 24,000
frames, six seeds, on the harness default bed **and** a fed one, puts the
zeroed brain at **0.0% of animals on 12 of 12 seed-runs** — the harness prints
its own verdict, *the bed has teeth*. It is a maximal-effect test and licenses
only that: the bed turns a *large* fitness difference into a population
difference. It cannot resolve a small one, and the arena's own 2.42–3.12x seed
noise — not the ecology — is why the flight races nulled, so those nulls are a
statistical-power problem. **Gate 2 for plants is untouched**, a different
harness on a different kingdom, and `selection_arena`'s finding stands there:
a null is a statement about the world rather than about the genome.

**Re-derive file ownership from the open PR list, never from a table in a
note.** Round one's ownership table was landed whole by PR #170 and every later
round edited those files; `CLAUDE.md`'s own rule says the roster you were
handed is a claim about the past. `sim::frame::step` is the tick sequence
shared by both binaries, and its guard
`frame_step_matches_the_sequence_app_update_ran_before_extraction` holds a hash
taken from the other side of the extraction — **if it goes red either a phase
moved deliberately (re-take the number and say what moved) or a phase was added
to one binary's loop and not to `frame::step`**, which is the failure the module
exists to prevent.

**The perf line's handed-forward list** (archived round nineteen, and
[`../evolution-lab-frame-cost-2026-09-01.md`](../evolution-lab-frame-cost-2026-09-01.md)
§18.5, in order): the **~21% in the kernel and rayon**, the largest block left
by a wide margin; then the moisture pass, where what remains is per-cell
arithmetic; then the pheromone `roundf`, which is cheap and is **not**
behaviour-free. `step_organisms`' three pure levers were priced at under 1%
between them and are closed. **Rebuild the baseline binary after every merge** —
a hash gate is worthless against a stale one.

## Round twenty-three, 2026-09-09 — geometry was never the cap on breeding

*Second misread counter in two rounds, same shape, different file. The
mechanism is worth more than the finding.*

**§4f's "88% of affordable births fail on geometry" is withdrawn.**
`births_denied_no_space` is incremented **every tick a parent tries**, and the
denial branch does not charge the parent — so an ant refused on one tick and
born on the next is counted in the denied column *and* the born column.
Nothing failed. The original 1,171 against 157 is **7.5 retries per birth**,
about 45 frames of waiting.

`births_denied_animals` (new; a 4,096-bit set on `World`, exact rather than
inferred) gives the denominator. Six 48,000-frame runs, `RAYON_NUM_THREADS=1`:

| bed | born | attempts | animals | ticks each | the old ratio |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 8 plants | 19, 25, 29 | 70, 109, 71 | 5, 4, 7 | 14, 27, 10 | 79%, 81%, 71% |
| 48 plants | 102, 83, 101 | 1118, 236, 1569 | 28, 38, 34 | 40, 6, 46 | 92%, 74%, 94% |

**The percentage reproduces — 71–94%, bracketing 88% — and it counts retries
per birth.** Median wait **21 ticks, ~124 frames**, for the quarter to half of
parents that ever meet it, against a ~12,000-frame generation: about **1% of a
generation**. So *"who reproduces is decided by standing room"* and
*"demography is currently geometry"* do not follow. What survives is that
crowding bites harder as the bed fills — the fed bed's attempts run an order
of magnitude above the starved bed's. **Generations remain the only cap named
in §4f that stands.**

**The page carries the pair now**, `NO ROOM n OVER m ANIMALS`, with the help
string saying attempts-over-animals is a wait rather than a loss.
`a_walled_in_parent_is_many_attempts_and_one_animal` pins the maximal case —
one funded parent, stone on every side — and was watched going red with the
bit test defeated: **44 attempts, animal counter 44 instead of 1.**

**For anyone measuring anything here, this is the round's real output.** Two
counters in two days were arithmetically correct and about a different
question than the one asked. Both had a tell that was there to be read:
`EVER`/`BIRTHS` had *tidiness* (a monotone 199 → 987 on a bed with 8x seed
spread), and this one had a **failure branch that charges nothing** — read the
branch before the ratio. And the fix for an ambiguous count is **a second
count, not a better ratio**: one animal walled in for fifty ticks and fifty
animals waiting one tick are the same total and opposite findings, and no
normalisation of the first number alone separates them.

*Re-test when body size becomes heritable* — `try_bud`'s own comment reserves
this counter for exactly that, since a bigger body needs a bigger free patch
and the wait would become a selection pressure for smallness.

## The earlier rounds

All twenty-two are verbatim in
[`../evolution-lab-rounds-archive.md`](../evolution-lab-rounds-archive.md),
which prices each one and maps it to its owning report. **Read the one round,
not the file** — they are three concurrent lines braided into one sequence, and
knowing which is yours is most of the saving:

| line | rounds | design of record |
|---|---|---|
| the lab as an instrument — interface, shelf, rosters, persistence, soil, scenarios, forage | 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, 21 | `evolution-lab-gui-physics-2026-08-30.md` |
| frame cost and the speed dial | 2, 6, 8, 17, 18, 19 | `evolution-lab-frame-cost-2026-09-01.md` |
| creatures — groups, kin, armour, castes, verbs, gates | 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 20, 22 | `creature-signature-and-castes-2026-09-06.md` |

## Environment notes that cost time here

- **The container suspends between tool calls**, so a backgrounded job makes
  no progress while the session is idle. `cargo test --lib` does not fit in
  one foreground call. **Let CI be the gate on the full suite** — it runs on
  branch pushes as well as pull requests.
- **Every push cancels the in-flight suite and restarts a ~19-minute clock**,
  so batch commits. A run whose jobs all read "cancelled" two seconds in is
  the concurrency group superseding a push run with a pull_request run, not a
  failure.
- `rust-toolchain.toml` pins 1.98 and CI has a build cache, so plain
  `cargo clippy --all-targets --release --locked -- -D warnings` matches CI.
- **The lab window captures with no display** —
  `PIXEL_PHYSICS_SCREENSHOT_AFTER_FRAMES=N` under `xvfb-run` with lavapipe.
  `labshot` renders the *world* and shows no interface; `examples/labui.rs`
  renders the bar headlessly and scripts clicks.
- **`/tmp` is shared between agents in this container** and the screenshot
  hook writes `$TMPDIR/pixel_physics_lab.png` — one lane captured another
  lane's frame. **Set a private `TMPDIR`.**
- **`review.py inbox --mark-seen` marked all 199 cards seen**, not just the
  caller's. Use `get <id>` rather than trusting an empty inbox.
- **Several agents in one container makes every timing untrustworthy** — two
  byte-identical `ascii` runs have disagreed 2.42x here. Pin
  `RAYON_NUM_THREADS` or compare arms inside one run; the general rule is in
  `CLAUDE.md`.
- **Cloud lanes cannot be messaged.** `SendMessage` does not resolve a
  `create_session` child, so a brief cannot be narrowed once it is running.
  Write briefs that degrade well: say what to land first and to report the
  rest.
